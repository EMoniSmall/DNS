<h1>Understanding DNS ðŸ’¡</h1>

> [!Note]
> What is DNS?
> DNS stands for Domain Name System. It's like a phonebook that translates a website address into a numerical IP address so computers can identify each other on the internet. It makes it more simpler for a computer to find the correct server host.

<h2>Expectations ðŸ¤”</h2>

> [!Important]
> You'll need two VMs for this: A Domain Controller and a Client with Active Directory Set up. If you need guidance on how to create these, you can refer to the [Active Directory Configuration Guide](https://github.com/EMoniSmall/ad-configure).

- Inspect DNS A-Records on the server

- Create some custom A-Records to observe from the client VM

- Delete Records from the server and inspect/clear client DNS Cache

- Gain an understanding of "CNAME" records.
